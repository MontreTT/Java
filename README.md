The algorithm used in the program is Heap Sort, and it operates as follows:

Data Structure: A heap is maintained throughout the program. Cities are added to this heap. In part A of the task, the array is used as a max-heap, while in part B and part C, it is used as a min-heap for ease of implementation.

Heap Sort Algorithm:

The first element of the heap is the maximum (for max-heap) or minimum (for min-heap) element, depending on the part of the task.
It is swapped with the last element, and the heap is reconstructed.
The current element is then swapped with the second-to-last element, and the heap is reconstructed again.
This process continues until there is only one element left in the heap.
Number of Iterations: The algorithm runs a total of 'n' iterations, where 'n' is the number of elements in the heap. In each iteration, the first (or last) element is swapped and the heap is reconstructed.

Complexity Analysis: The total complexity of the algorithm is 
)
O(n
log(n)
). This is because, in each iteration, log(n) heap operations are performed, and the total number of iterations is 'n'.

For part B and part C:

A secondary array is created to store the first 'k' elements.
The array is then sorted to form a min-heap.
The root of the heap (the minimum element) is compared with incoming elements, and if it is greater, the root is replaced, and the heap is restructured.
The comparison operation takes 


O(1) time, and restructuring the heap takes 
O(log(k)
) time.
The overall complexity remains 
O(n
log(k)
), where 'k' is the number of elements to be maintained in the heap.
This algorithm minimizes memory usage compared to O(n) memory requirement and is faster, especially when 'k' is much smaller than 'n', as log(k) is much smaller than log(n).
